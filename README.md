# disclaimer
This is a project I work on in my spare time. So don't expect updates to come out fast.

You have a problem with the game? I gave you the Source Code. Fix it yourself.

This project was done using the Nightly Build of Ren'Py. So expect some bugs.

Don't bother doing any bug reports. I won't answer them.
